    <section>A Terms and Conditions agreement outlines the terms that visitors must agree to if they want to interact with your website. Essentially, if the visitor continues to use the website after accepting the Terms, they enter into a contract with you.

        Unlike a <a href="exercise.html">Privacy Policy</a>, you aren't legally required to have a <a href="exercise.html">Terms and Conditions</a> agreement. However, there are many reasons why you should draft one and display it on your website. We'll discuss those reasons and show you a few of the most important clauses your Terms and Conditions should include.
        
        Note that you'll sometimes see this agreement referred to as a Terms of Use, User Agreement or <a href="exercise.html">Terms of Service</a>agreement. These terms are interchangeable and refer to the same type of agreement.
